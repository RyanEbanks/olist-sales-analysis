## Project Background
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce company founded in 2015 in which they connect smaller and medium-sized business to major online market places. I analyzed this company's dataset to answer key business questions. I sourced these questions from actual day-to-day inquiries in an unrelated company's email, effectively simulating real world scenarios in order to improve performance across sales and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary
Our analysis of Olist's 103,877 records across 2023-2024 highlights key trends in sales, refund behaviour, and seasonal performance across Brazil. São Paolo led all states with a 37.47% growth rate, reinforcing its role as Brazil's primary market. The performance of sales tended to decline in states further away from São Paolo.

In both years May was the highest performing month, generating over $1 million 2023 and more than $2 million in 2024. This contributed to Spring  having the strongest seasonal performance, totaling over $6 million. Summer followed closely in revenue but showed the highest refund rate of 0.90%, still within acceptable limits. 

Rondônia has the highest state level refund rate at 2.75% suggesting a potential area for review.
