## Project Background
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce company founded in 2015 in which they connect smaller and medium-sized business to major online market places. I analyzed this company's dataset to answer key business questions. I sourced these questions from actual day-to-day inquiries in an unrelated company's email, effectively simulating real world scenarios in order to improve performance across sales and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary
Our analysis of Olist's 103,877 records across 2023-2024 highlights key trends in sales, refund behaviour, and seasonal performance across Brazil. São Paolo led all states with a 37.47% growth rate, reinforcing its role as Brazil's primary market. The performance of sales tended to decline in states further away from São Paolo.

May had the highest growth rate over the 2 years, generating over $1.2 million in sales. This contributed to Spring having the strongest seasonal performance, totaling over $6 million. Summer followed closely in revenue but showed the highest refund rate of 0.90%, still within acceptable limits. 

Rondônia has the highest state level refund rate at 2.75% suggesting a potential area for review.

## Recommendations
### Maximizing Sales and Growth Rates
* __Expand Beyond São Paulo:__ São Paulo dominates sales, perfomance drops in states farther from this hub. Increasing outreach, promotions, and logistics support in underperforming states can unlock new markets.
* __Capitalize on Seasonal Opportunities:__ While spring leads in sales, other seasons including summer, fall and christmas offer untapped revenue. Launching seasonal compaigns and promotions during those times can incentivise growth.
* __Boost Repeat Purchases with Loyalty Programs:__ Introducing seasonal themed events, rewards and loyalty programs can encourage customers to buy multiple of the same items. This could strengthen customer retention and average oder value.

### Maintaining Low Refund Rates
* __Replicate Effective Practices:__ Identify what worked during the months with low refund and apply those practices across the board, including product quality checks and better delivery communication.
* __Analyze Refund Patterns by State:__ Conduct a deeper analysis into which products and categories are most refunded in each state. This will help tailer better solutions whether its product sourcing or customer service interventions based on regional trends.
